      "summary": "Will Larson and Lenny discuss how the engineering landscape has shifted from the zero-interest-rate \u201cgrowth at all costs\u201d era to a tighter market where hiring slows, teams consolidate, and leaders must focus more on execution, allocation, and accountability. Will argues that treating engineers as true peers\u2014giving them real responsibility and holding them accountable\u2014enables stronger engineering leadership and unlocks senior IC growth paths (e.g., Staff+ roles). Listeners learn how expectations for engineering managers and directors are changing and why this moment can be an opportunity for engineers to take on more meaningful leadership.",
