  "description": "This theme covers how great products are intentionally designed\u2014across UX, brand, and organizational habits\u2014to create clear value, emotional resonance, and durable differentiation. Across episodes, guests explore how to develop product taste, operationalize craft at scale, and adapt design practices for AI-era products where interfaces are conversational, behavior is non-deterministic, and iteration loops must be tighter.",
