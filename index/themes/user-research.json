  "description": "User Research across these episodes is about building an accurate, decision-driving understanding of customers: what triggers their behavior, what \u201cprogress\u201d they\u2019re trying to make, and how products fit into their real-world context. It addresses how to find and interpret high-signal qualitative and quantitative evidence (especially early), how to avoid solution-first/vanity research, and how to operationalize customer insight into product, design, growth, and go-to-market decisions\u2014because most product failure modes trace back to weak or misused customer understanding.",
