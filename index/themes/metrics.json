  "description": "Metrics is the podcast\u2019s through-line for turning strategy into measurable progress: choosing what to measure, how to measure it credibly, and how to use measurement to make better product, growth, and org decisions. Across episodes, guests emphasize that good metrics systems prevent local optimization (e.g., short-term conversion at the expense of retention or trust), create fast learning loops via experimentation/evals, and align teams on outcomes rather than activity.",
