  "description": "Pricing across these episodes is treated as a core product strategy (not a finance afterthought): how you package value, set willingness-to-pay anchors, and choose a monetization model that matches your product\u2019s value delivery and go-to-market motion. The theme covers how pricing evolves with maturity (PLG \u2192 PLS/enterprise), how to avoid early pricing traps (especially in AI), and how to use experimentation and research to improve retention, expansion, and long-term profitability.",

    "Designing pricing from day one: avoiding early anchors that cap willingness-to-pay and constrain future expansion",
    "Choosing the right pricing model (seat-based, usage-based, tiered/freemium, hybrid, outcome-based) based on value metric, attribution, and customer maturity",
    "Packaging and paywalls: defining free vs paid boundaries, feature gating, and when to shift from self-serve to product-led sales",
    "Pricing as an ongoing product loop: research, segmentation, experimentation, and iteration rather than \u201cset and forget\u201d",
    "Monetization + retention linkage: connecting users to core value, reducing churn, and driving expansion through better value realization",
    "Enterprise pricing dynamics: differentiation, discount discipline, and structuring deals around value/outcomes instead of commoditized feature checklists"
