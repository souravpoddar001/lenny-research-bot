  "description": "This theme covers how AI/ML is reshaping product strategy, development, and company operations\u2014from building reliable AI features to designing agentic experiences and finding defensible distribution. Across episodes, guests address why AI products fail (non-determinism, evaluation gaps, weak iteration loops), how to operationalize learning (evals, post-training, experimentation), and what new moats and org designs matter as models commoditize and capabilities accelerate.",
