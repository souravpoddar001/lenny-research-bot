  "description": "Product-market fit (PMF) across these episodes is treated as a moving target: finding a repeatable value proposition for a specific customer in a specific context, then proving it with retention, pull, and a scalable distribution motion. The theme addresses how to diagnose whether growth problems are really acquisition issues vs. weak/shifted PMF, how to narrow to a beachhead, and how to evolve positioning, category, and strategy as markets and competitors change\u2014because scaling before PMF (or after PMF has drifted) is one of the fastest paths to wasted spend and team burnout.",
