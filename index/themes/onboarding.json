  "description": "Across episodes, onboarding is treated as the highest-leverage \u201cfirst-mile\u201d of the product: the set of experiences that turn a new user (or new employee) from curiosity into meaningful activation. Guests repeatedly frame onboarding as where brand promise meets reality, where instrumentation and clear ownership matter most, and where small frictions compound into lost retention, revenue, and trust.",
