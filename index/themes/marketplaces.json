  "description": "Across these episodes, \u201cMarketplaces\u201d covers how to design, launch, and scale two-sided (or multi-sided) systems where value depends on balancing supply, demand, and trust. The theme repeatedly tackles why marketplace changes create second-order effects (winners/losers), how to operationalize quality and liquidity, and how product, data, and operations must work together to make the ecosystem durable and fair.",
