  "description": "Fundraising across these episodes is treated less as a single pitch event and more as an ongoing process of narrative-building, signal creation, and survival under uncertainty. The theme covers how founders earn conviction (or decide not to raise), how to communicate a compelling \u201cwhy now\u201d story, and how to manage runway, rejection, and investor dynamics\u2014because capital strategy shapes product focus, hiring, speed, and ultimately company outcomes.",
