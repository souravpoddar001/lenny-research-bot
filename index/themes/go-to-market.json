  "description": "Go-to-market (GTM) across these episodes is about turning product value into repeatable distribution: choosing the right motion (PLG/PLS/sales-led/community/category), crafting a narrative and positioning that makes buying easy, and building durable channels and growth loops. The theme repeatedly addresses why \u201cmore tactics\u201d often fails (especially when PMF or market conditions shift), and why the best GTM systems align product, marketing, and sales around a clear story, clear ICP, and measurable paths to revenue.",

    "Growth loops and quarterly investment focus (identify loops, instrument them, and allocate resources to the highest-leverage constraints)",
    "Channel testing and \u201cdistribution shift\u201d thinking: run small, fast tests; look for emerging platform windows before incumbents adapt",
    "Category design vs. category competition: validate via buyer language, budget availability, and competitive dynamics (competition as proof a category is real)",
