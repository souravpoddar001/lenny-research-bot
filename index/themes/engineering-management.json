  "description": "Engineering Management across these episodes focuses on how leaders design teams, processes, and culture to ship high-quality software quickly\u2014especially under uncertainty from AI, fast growth, and shifting platforms. It addresses how to structure ownership, align product and engineering, set operating rhythms, hire and develop talent, and build feedback loops that keep execution fast without losing reliability or morale.",
