  "description": "Growth Strategy across these episodes focuses on how companies create repeatable, defensible growth by aligning product value, distribution, and operating systems\u2014rather than chasing isolated tactics. It addresses when to prioritize activation/retention vs. new acquisition, how to build growth loops and teams, and how to choose channels and positioning in changing markets\u2014because sustainable growth increasingly depends on both superior product experience and superior distribution.",
