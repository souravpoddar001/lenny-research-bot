  "description": "Across these episodes, \u201cHiring\u201d is treated as a strategic operating system: defining what \u201cgreat\u201d looks like for a role, selecting for it with signal-rich processes, and then onboarding and managing in ways that compound performance. The theme addresses when to hire (vs. fix product/strategy first), how to avoid role/level mismatches, and how talent density, ownership, and clear mechanisms determine whether teams scale with speed or bureaucracy.",
