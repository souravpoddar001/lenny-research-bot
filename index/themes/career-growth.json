  "description": "Career Growth across these episodes focuses on how to make better role and company decisions, build the skills and relationships that compound over time, and stay effective (and healthy) as scope and pressure increase. It addresses questions like: what to optimize for at different career stages, how to seek high-signal feedback and mentorship, how to become more strategic and executive-minded, and how to avoid common traps like prestige-chasing, misfit roles, and burnout.",
