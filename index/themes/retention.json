  "description": "Retention across these episodes is treated as the clearest proof of real product value and the foundation of durable growth\u2014more reliable than acquisition spikes or funnel optics. The theme covers how to define and measure \u201ccoming back,\u201d design product systems that build habits and repeat value, and run experimentation and monetization in ways that improve long-term customer outcomes rather than short-term metrics.",
