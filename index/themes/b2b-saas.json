  "description": "This theme covers how modern B2B SaaS companies win: by choosing (or shaping) the right category, nailing positioning and narrative, and building a go-to-market that matches how buyers actually adopt and purchase software. Across episodes, it addresses why deals stall into \u201cno decision,\u201d how product-led growth evolves into product-led sales, and how AI and faster shipping cycles are changing differentiation, pricing, and the pace of iteration\u2014especially in enterprise contexts where governance and security matter.",
