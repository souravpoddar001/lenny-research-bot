  "description": "Across these episodes, \u201cCompany Culture\u201d is treated as an operating system: the set of values, mechanisms, and day-to-day behaviors that determine how decisions get made, how teams collaborate, and what quality bar the company can sustain at scale. The theme repeatedly asks how leaders intentionally shape culture (vs. letting it drift), how culture shows up in execution (hiring, feedback, meetings, metrics), and how to preserve speed and ownership while growing headcount, complexity, and stakes.",
