  "description": "Across these episodes, \u201cCommunication\u201d is treated as a core leadership and product skill: how you gather signal, create shared understanding, and drive decisions and action under ambiguity. The theme spans internal communication (feedback, alignment, meetings, decision-making) and external communication (positioning, sales narratives, brand storytelling), showing that clarity and context\u2014not charisma\u2014are what reduce friction and accelerate execution.",
