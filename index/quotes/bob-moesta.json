So think about it as there's got to be energy in the system for us to do something. And there's what I call functional energy, which is usually time, space, effort, knowledge, right? There's emotional energy, which is how I feel. I want to feel better, I feel frustrated, I feel overlooked. There's emotional aspects to it. And then there's social aspects, how I want others to perceive me or how others perceive me, \"Oh, my boss is going to fire me because he doesn't think I'm doing this fast enough and I feel inadequate.\" So part of his understanding kind of the emotional, social and functional components that are part of that energy source.",
