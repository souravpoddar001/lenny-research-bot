Low momentum leads to more low momentum because there's this energy that- that kinda goes through companies where, when there is momentum, when people are shipping, when things are going well, other people feel that energy, and they wanna do the same, but in the reverse, someone who might be slowing things down, not shipping, not really performing very well, that actually does the reverse too.",
