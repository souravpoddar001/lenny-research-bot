      "text": "In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.",
