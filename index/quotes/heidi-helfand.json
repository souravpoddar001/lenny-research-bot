Teams grow bigger and then they split into two or more teams. Opposite of grow and split is merging. Sometimes two or more teams merge together. It's more of a shrinking pattern. We might be seeing more of this these days as companies downsize. Things merge together and consolidate. Isolation is, or innovation by isolation. Start a new team off to the side, a beneficial silo, give that team process freedom, great for catalyzing new product lines within your existing company. Also great for emergencies and they just happen anyway if we have incidents and people have to come together, solve an incident and then go back to their teams. And switching.
