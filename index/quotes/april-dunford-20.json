Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, \"I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see,\" and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.",
