      "text": "So the better approach is just to be transparent and I see it pretty regularly and there's absolutely no shame in sending a note that says something like, \"Hey, we're looking for an exit for our company X, Y, and Z didn't pan out as we expected. We built a really interesting product and we want to keep the team together. We're running a process. Are you interested?\" Really just as simple as that.",

It's their job to meet absolutely every company that could be potentially interested. So take that meeting, say you're not interested in an acquisition just yet, but push them to make an introduction to someone that could sponsor the deal. So usually that's someone in product or maybe a GM and use that as a starting point for maybe just a conversation, maybe something more like a partnership but get the corp dev team to work for you.",
