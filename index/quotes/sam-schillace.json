      "text": "I always think that product builders and entrepreneurs, you have this really hard problem of you have to be very rigid about your mission. I know where I'm going. I know what my mission is, and I'm going to go there because the world doesn't care, it's going to push back. But you also have to be really flexible about feedback. You're probably aren't going to be right about a bunch of it. And so you have to blend these two things together somehow.",

So let's go advertise on Google and see how much it costs to get people to sort of show up, and then we'll figure out if we have a subscription business or not.\"",
